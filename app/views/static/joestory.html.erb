I went from 220lb to 150lb by tracking what I was eating and exercising, and looking at my trends. I realized that when I would "treat" myself to a night of drinks and food it could cancel out as much as an entire weeks worth of dieting. Thus, in order to get back to square one, I have to diet for a week to cancel out my bad behavior, and for another week to actually progress on my weight loss journey. After I started analyzing my data and identifying trends when I was veering off course, diet and exercise became much easier.
